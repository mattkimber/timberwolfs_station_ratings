# Timberwolf's Station Ratings

A small utility GRF to provide station ratings more appropriate to my
style of play, and prevent games being dominated by solely boats and
aircraft by punishing "boring" networks.

## Building

You will need Go >= 1.18 and NML installed in ../nml, also the
standard GoRender setup used in my other sets.

```
go build -o cargosprites.exe cmd/cargosprites.go
./build.sh
```
